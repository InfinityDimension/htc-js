Shift JS is a JavaScript library for [Htc - the cryptocurrency and blockchain application platform]
(https://github.com/HealthTrace/htc-core). It allows developers to create offline transactions and broadcast
them onto the network. It also allows developers to interact with the core Htc API,
for retrieval of collections and single records of data located on the Htc blockchain.
 Its main benefit is that it does not require a locally installed Htc node,
  and instead utilizes the existing peers on the network. It can be used from the client as a
  [browserify](http://browserify.org/) compiled module, or on the server as a standard Node.js module.
